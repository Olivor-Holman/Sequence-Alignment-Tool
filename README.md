# Sequence-Alignment-Tool

Doesn't actually work right now
Simple tool that takes two sequences, and finds and returns the best alignment

To use, load the main script, and at the end use the function 'align(sequence1, sequence2')' which will return your sequence alignment in a notepad file in your current working directory. Also contains functions 'complement(sequence)' and 'reverse_complement(sequence)', the functions of which should be self explanatory.
